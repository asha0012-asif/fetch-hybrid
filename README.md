# Hybrid Fetch Assignment

This is a program which allows the user to search anything and it will display images which relate to the user input.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this assignment was to use fetch to receive JSON data from the PixaBay API, do another fetch call using a url from this first fetch call to receive the blobs, so that it can be displayed to the page using DOM manipulation techniques.
